-------------------------------------
Body Parser is a middleware of Node JS used to handle HTTP POST request. Body Parser can parse string based client request body into JavaScript Object which we can use in our application.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is one of the most popular template engines for JavaScript. As the name suggests, it lets us embed JavaScript code in a template language that is then used to generate HTML.
